This is the official repository for the implemntation of simulation experiments of CRIL: Continual Robot Imitation Learning via Generative Dynamics Model by [Chongkai Gao](http://chongkaigao.com/), Haichuan Gao, Shangqi Guo, Tianren Zhang and Feng Chen.

CRIL is a specialized deep generative replay algorithm designed for continual robot imitation learning that employs both a dynamics predictor and WGAN-GP for trajectory replay. The results of simulation and realworld experiments and the generated images are as follows:

## Installation
The simulation experiments of CRIL are based on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmark, which need to be installed in advance. You can follow these instructions to install [mujoco-py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#install-mujoco) and [meta-world](https://github.com/rlworkgroup/metaworld).
